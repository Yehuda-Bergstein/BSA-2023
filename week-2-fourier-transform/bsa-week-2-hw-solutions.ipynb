    "To answer **Question 1**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- As $\\sigma$ approaches zero, the Gaussian function becomes infinitely narrow and tall, converging to the Dirac Delta function. The Dirac Delta function, $\\delta(x)$, is not a function in the traditional sense but a distribution that is zero everywhere except at $x = 0$, where it is infinitely tall such that its integral over the entire real line is 1. Mathematically, in the limit as $\\sigma \\to 0$, $G(x)$ approaches $\\delta(x)$, symbolically represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\lim_{\\sigma \\to 0} G(x) = \\delta(x) $\n",

    "This implies that for a very small $\\sigma$, $G(x)$ is a good approximation of $\\delta(x)$, used in various applications where a practical implementation of the Dirac Delta function is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the context of processing continuous signals, approximating the Dirac Delta function with a Gaussian allows for practical implementations in digital signal processing and simulations. Since the Dirac Delta is idealized and cannot be directly implemented in real-world systems due to its infinite amplitude and infinitesimal width, using a Gaussian provides a manageable approximation. This approximation is particularly useful in signal processing for functions like impulse response, where the Dirac Delta function is used to characterize systems. By approximating $\\delta(x)$ with a narrow Gaussian, we can effectively simulate the impact of an impulse on a system in a way that is computationally feasible and physically realizable.\n",

In signal analysis, the Dirac Delta function can be used to model impulses or instantaneous events within signals, allowing for the analysis of systems' responses to such events. In synthesis, it enables the construction of more complex signals from simple components. For example, any continuous signal can theoretically be represented as an infinite sum of scaled and shifted Dirac Delta functions. This property is fundamental to various signal processing techniques, including sampling and reconstruction, where signals are sampled at discrete points (modeled as multiplication by a series of Dirac Delta functions) and then reconstructed to approximate the original continuous signal.\n",

    "  - The **time domain** represents a signal in terms of its amplitude over time. It is the most intuitive way to visualize a signal, showing how the signal changes at each moment. Time-domain graphs typically display the signal amplitude (or some other physical quantity) as a function of time.\n",
    "  - The **frequency domain**, on the other hand, represents a signal in terms of its constituent frequencies. It shows how much of the signal's energy is present at different frequency components. Frequency-domain graphs display amplitude (or power) as a function of frequency, rather than time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importance of Transformation**:\n",
    "  - Transforming signals from the time domain to the frequency domain is essential for understanding the signal's behavior in terms of its frequency content. Many signals contain information encoded in their frequency components, and some signal characteristics are more easily analyzed and manipulated in the frequency domain. For example, it can be easier to identify and filter out unwanted noise or to analyze the harmonic content of a signal.\n",
