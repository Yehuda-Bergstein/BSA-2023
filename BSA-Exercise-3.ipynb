    "Convolution, often denoted with $ \\circledast $ is a fundamental operation in signal processing, especially relevant in neurophysiological signal analysis. It involves combining two signals to form a third signal, illustrating how one signal modifies the other over time. Specifically, convolution is defined as **is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted.**. This is represented mathematically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "(f * g)(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\tau) g(t - \\tau) d\\tau\n",

    "Solving this integral is a complex operation. Not just for humans, but even for computing machines. The Fourier Transform significantly speeds up the process of convolving two functions by transforming the convolution operation in the time domain into a simpler multiplication operation in the frequency domain. This is based on the Convolution Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider two functions $ f $ and $ g $, and their convolution $ f \\circledast g $. The convolution theorem states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathcal{F}\\{f \\circledast g\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\} \\cdot \\mathcal{F}\\{g\\}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\} $ and $ \\mathcal{F}\\{g\\} $ are the Fourier Transforms of $ f $ and $ g $ respectively. This theorem implies that instead of directly convolving $ f $ and $ g $, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the Fourier Transforms of $ f $ and $ g $.\n",
    "2. Multiply these transforms point-wise.\n",
    "3. Apply the Inverse Fourier Transform to the result of this multiplication to obtain $ f * g $.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if $ f[n] $ and $ g[n] $ are two signals with Fourier Transforms $ f(\\omega) $ and $ g(\\omega) $ respectively, then the convolution of $ f[n] $ and $ g[n] $ is equivalent to the multiplication of $ f(\\omega) $ and $ g(\\omega) $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "y[n] \\longleftrightarrow Y(\\omega)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "F\\{f(t) \\circledast g(t)\\} = f(\\omega) \\cdot g(\\omega) = Y(\\omega)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational complexity advantage arises from the fact that the direct computation of the convolution is typically an $ O(n^2) $ operation, where $ n $ is the number of points in the functions $ f $ and $ g $. However, using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, the Fourier Transform and its inverse can be computed in $ O(n \\log n) $ time. This makes the overall process of computing the convolution via the Fourier Transform significantly faster for large $ n $, especially since the point-wise multiplication in the frequency domain is an $ O(n) $ operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the process using Fourier Transforms is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FFT of $ f $: $ O(n \\log n) $\n",
    "2. FFT of $ g $: $ O(n \\log n) $\n",
    "3. Point-wise multiplication: $ O(n) $\n",
    "4. Inverse FFT: $ O(n \\log n) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the total complexity is dominated by the FFT and its inverse, making it much faster than the direct \\( O(n^2) \\) convolution approach for large datasets.\n"
