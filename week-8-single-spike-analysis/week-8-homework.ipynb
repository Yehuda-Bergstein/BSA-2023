    "### Poisson Process - Refractory Period\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we'll model the refractory period of a neuron, and later look at its ISI and TIH.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 \n",
    "Use the Poisson process generator from last week to create a spike train with $r_0=30$ spikes per second over 60 seconds. Display the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Now add a refractory period parameter to the function, and set it to 1 millisecond. The simulation of\n",
    "the refractory period should follow these guidelines: After each spike set the\n",
    "firing rate to 0. Then allow it to recover linearly back to $r_0$ with the recovery rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "r(t) = r_0\\frac{t-t_{spike}}{5}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t_{spike}$ is the time of last spike, and both\n",
    "$t$ and $t_{spike}$ are timed in milliseconds. Remember that $r(t)$ shouldn't\n",
    "recover above the initial firing rate $r_0$. Plot the resulting spike train\n",
    "overlaid with $r(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3\n",
    "Plot the following quantities for your newly-formed spike train:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.1\n",
    "Show using MATLAB's `conv` function, or Python's `numpy.convolve`\n",
    "that convolution is a commutative operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2\n",
    "Convolve these two signals first with the mentioned functions, and then with your\n",
    "own code. Write a function that convolves two signals without using any external libraries' built-in convolution function (more general functions such as `np.dot` are permissable).\n",
    "\n",
    "`x = [1 5 7 9 3 3 3 9 8] ; y = [1 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution should be done in the 'full' mode, meaning that all possible\n",
    "multiplications of these signals should occur. Remember, The definition of\n",
    "convolution is: $(x*y)[n] = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}{x[m] y[m-n]}$. Additionaly,\n",
    "take note that Matlab flips the second vector that enters the `conv`\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1\n",
    "Using the spike generator from the previous part, create a function that can be\n",
    "used as $r(t)$ of a **bursty** neuron. Create the spike train and plot it.\n",
    "Don't drop the refractory period part.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2\n",
    "Adapt your homemade convolution function and refactor it into a correlation function. Auto-correlate the spike train with itself using this function.\n",
    "What does the amplitude of the center peak represent? Normalize the correlation by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3\n",
    "Create two oscillating neurons with the same method as the previous question -\n",
    "first generate two fitting $r(t)$ and then randomize the spike train\n",
    "accordingly.\n",
    "Compute the cross-correlation of the neurons using your function. Explain the result - both the time lag ($x$-axis data) of\n",
    "the peaks and their amplitude ($y$-axis).\n"
