    "### Introduction to Neural Decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoding in neuroscience refers to the interpretation of neural signals to infer the original sensory stimulus or the intended motor action. This field holds significant importance in understanding brain function and developing brain-computer interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bayesian Decoding Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilize Bayesian methods for decoding by inverting the generalized linear encoding model, applying Bayes' rule to estimate the posterior probability of the stimulus given the observed spikes. This involves assuming a prior distribution for the stimulus and computing the likelihood of the observed spikes given the stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "In the MAP approach, we aim to find the stimulus that is most probable given the observed spike response. This requires maximizing the posterior probability, which combines our prior knowledge with the evidence from the observed data. It is particularly useful when the stimulus interacts linearly with model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Stimulus Reconstruction\n",
    "Linear Stimulus Reconstruction is a technique used to predict the stimulus that caused a series of spikes in neural data. This method is critical for understanding how neurons encode information about stimuli.\n",
    "The core of this reconstruction technique is the use of a linear filter, which is applied to the observed spike times. The filter is designed to optimally predict the stimulus that caused these spikes.\n",
    "For linear stimulus reconstruction, we predict the stimulus \\( x(t) \\) by linearly filtering observed spike times. The goal is to determine the optimal filter shape, \\( k \\), for the best linear estimation of the stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Least-Squares Regression for Optimal Linear Estimator (OLE)\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the filter \\( k \\), we perform a least-squares regression of the spike data onto the stimulus. This involves discretizing both time and the temporal filter to solve the optimization problem. The OLE is the solution that minimizes the squared error between the predicted and actual stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the equation \\( x(t) = x_0 + \\sum_f k(t - t^f) \\), \\( x(t) \\) is the predicted stimulus at time \\( t \\), \\( x_0 \\) is a constant, \\( k \\) is the temporal filter, and \\( t^f \\) are the observed spike times.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal filter \\( k \\) is the heart of the model. It is a function that describes how spike timings are related to the stimulus.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessing Decoding Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessing decoding uncertainty involves evaluating the posterior variance. Regions of small posterior variance indicate features of the stimulus that are more accurately encoded by the neural response, while large variances point to less certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications in Vision and Neuroprosthetics\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Decoding has significant applications in vision and neuroprosthetics. For instance, reconstructing visual stimuli from neuronal activity can help improve visual prosthetics. Similarly, decoding motor intentions from cortical activity can aid in the development of advanced neuroprosthetic limbs.\"\n"
