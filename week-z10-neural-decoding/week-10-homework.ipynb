Differentiate between the point types by using the 'c' argument in the scatter plot function to apply color based on the labels.\n"

Your function should output the index of the decoding base PSTH and the associated distances to all PSTHs, like so: \"The measured distances to the four PSTHs were: d1, d2, d3, d4.
