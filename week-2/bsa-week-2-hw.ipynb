There may be additional weaker rhythmic activity in the data, but these features remain hidden in the plot because of the large 60 Hz peak. We could state that the 60 Hz peak saturates the vertical scale. One technique to emphasize lower-amplitude rhythms hidden by large-amplitude oscillations is to change the scale of the spectrum to **decibels**. The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale. To convert our scale to decibels, we divide the spectrum by the maximum value observed in it, and then take the base 10 logarithm of this ratio. Finally, we multiply the result by 10."
