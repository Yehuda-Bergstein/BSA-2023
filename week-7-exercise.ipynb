    "Convolving a spike train with a temporal window yields $r(t)$, the time-varying spike rate. Examination of the aforementioned equation reveals its representation of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system, characterized by a summation of delta functions at distinct time points. This observation underpins the mathematical foundations of our subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to delineate and scrutinize spike trains, explicitly excluding sub-threshold activities and treating spikes from a singular neuron as uniform. These presumptions, while rational, necessitate explicit acknowledgment. We acknowledge the inherent variability in spike timings; identical experimental conditions do not guarantee reproducible neuronal responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is on developing a model that quantifies the **probability** of observing a specific spike or sequence of spikes in response to a stimulus. While this model does not enable the prediction of every spike, it significantly enhances our comprehension of neural encoding and decoding mechanisms. By defining the probability density function (PDF) of spike timings $p(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)$ and integrating it over a time window $\\Delta t$, we obtain the aggregate probability for an $n$-spike sequence within specified intervals:\n",

    "P(t_1,\\ldots,t_n) = p(t_1,\\ldots,t_n) (\\Delta t)^n\n",

    "\n",
    "The assumption of having comprehensive knowledge of $p(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)$ for all instances is impractical due to the diversity in spike train patterns, which complicates any attempt to precisely approximate this function. A statistical approach to model all potential spike trains may offer a more generalized framework. The firing rate $r(t)$ is defined as the likelihood of a neuron firing within a brief interval around $t$. However, this rate might be influenced by preceding spikes, necessitating information on past events to predict subsequent ones, expressed as:\n",

    "    P(t) = P(t_n|t_1, \\ldots, t_{n-1})\n",

    "This presents a substantial challenge, as accurately simulating this probability function is complex. Simplification to consider spike probability at time $t$ as only dependent on the immediate preceding spike leads to:\n",

    "$\n",
    "    P(t_n|t_{n-1})\n",
    "$\n",

    "Termed a renewal process, this formulation is somewhat more tractable. Nevertheless, if spike probability is deemed independent of prior spikes, we are describing a Poisson Process, aligning with the \"independent spike hypothesis\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the probability of observing a spike at a given time $t$ is denoted by $P(t)$ and is contingent solely on $r(t)$. The likelihood of encountering a specific spike train with spikes at times $t_1, t_2, ..., t_n$ is captured by $P(t_1, t_2, ..., t_n)$. The probability distribution function of $P$ is $p$, indicating the probability of observing a particular spike train is $p(t_1, ..., t_n)(\\Delta t)^n$. The spike train model, represented by $\\rho(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\delta (t - t_i)}$, will be convolved with a window function to derive $r(t)$. This systematic approach enables a comprehensive analysis of spike trains and their underlying probabilistic structures."

To this end, we introduce a broader function $P_T(n)$, which represents the probability that any sequence of $n$ spikes occurs within a trial duration of $T$. This leads us to question the dependencies of $P_T(n)$. By partitioning the total observation period $T$ into $M$ intervals of length $\\Delta t = \\frac{T}{M}$, and assuming $\\Delta t$ is sufficiently small to preclude the occurrence of more than one spike within any interval, we identify three critical factors influencing $P_T(n)$:\n",

    "Suppose a spike occurs at time $t_i$. In the context of a homogeneous Poisson process, we consider the probability of generating the next spike within a small interval $\\Delta t$, after a time $\\tau$ has elapsed since the last spike. This scenario can be dissected into two probabilities:\n",

Given the memoryless property of the Poisson process, the probability of not firing for any given small interval is independent of history. For a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $r$, the probability of no spike in a small interval $\\Delta t$ is approximately $1 - r\\Delta t$.\n",

    "The average interspike interval (ISI) can be calculated by leveraging the exponential distribution that arises from the Poisson process's properties. The exponential distribution is given by:\n",

    "$ P(T > t) = e^{-rt} $\n",
